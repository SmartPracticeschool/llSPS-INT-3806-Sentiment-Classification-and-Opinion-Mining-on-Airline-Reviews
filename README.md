Sentiment Classification and Opinion Mining on Airline Reviews using ANNs

Sentiment analysis is gaining importance in the research study of text mining and natural language processing (NLP). There has been a rise in accessibility of online applications and a surge in social platforms for opinion sharing, online review websites, and personal blogs, which have captured the attention of stakeholders such as customers, organizations, and governments to analyze and explore these opinions. Therefore, the major role of sentiment classification is to analyze an online document such as a blog, comment, review and new items as a comprehensive sentiment and categories it as positive, negative, or neutral.
